# Term Project Proposal: Resume-Based Job Matcher

## 1. The Big Idea
My project aims to create a tool using Python that analyzes resumes and matches them with relevant job listings. The tool will analyze a resume, extract key skills and qualifications, and then search for job listings that require similar qualifications. My MVP is a basic resume analyzer that can extract skills and experience from text-based resumes (Word Doc), a simple matching algorithm to compare resume content with job descriptions, and output a list of matched job links or descriptions. My stretch goals are as follows:
- Support for Word Doc resume format.
- Integration with a job listing API for real-time job matching.
- A matching algorithm using NLP.
- A user-friendly interface for uploading resumes and displaying job matches (if feasible in time frame).

## 2. Learning Objectives
I am doing this project individually, so my goals are only independent goals. My goals are to gain proficiency in Python, especially in gathering and analyzing text data, understand and implement basic natural language processing techniques, and learn how to integrate and use external APIs.

## 3. Implementation Plan
- Research and select Python libraries for text parsing (python-docx for Word documents).
- Investigate potential job listing APIs for integration.
- Develop a basic algorithm for matching keywords from resumes to job descriptions.
- Explore natural language processing libraries (like nltk) for more advanced text analysis.
- Determine feasibility of handling different resume formats (not likely).

## 4. Project Schedule
- **Week 1**: Research - library selection, API investigation.
- **Weeks 2-4**: Development phase - building the resume analyzer and basic matching algorithm.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Testing, refinement, and review - integrate additional features (API integration, NLP), test with various resume samples, refine the matching algorithm, and make sure that the actual output is the expected output.

## 5. Collaboration Plan
I will follow an agile development approach, where I will design first, develop, then test each portion of my project. In terms of tools, I am doing this project alone so I will be doing all of my coding through VS Code and all the tasks will fall under me.

## 6. Risks and Limitations
The biggest risk is the complexity of gathering and analyzing various resume formats accurately, which is why I am trying to stick to only word doc forms of resumes. I also have limited access to comprehensive job listing APIs which could restrict the scope of job matching, and web scraping is pretty difficult because a lot of job listing websites have blockers. I also think it will be a risk in making sure that my project provides accuracy and relevance of the matching algorithm.

## 7. Additional Course Content
- Advanced Python programming techniques.
- In-depth study of natural language processing.
- Finding and integrating external APIs.
